# cargo-reaper-new

## NAME
cargo-reaper-new -- Create a new REAPER extension plugin.

## SYNOPSIS
`cargo-reaper new` _path_

## DESCRIPTION
This command will create a new Cargo package in the given directory that is set up for use with `cargo-reaper`.
This includes a simple template with a `Cargo.toml` manifest, sample source file, `reaper.toml` configuration file, and a `.gitignore` file.

## OPTIONS

`-h` </br>
`--help` </br>
  <dd>Print help information.</dd>

## EXAMPLES

```sh
cargo reaper new reaper_my_plugin
```

> _**Important**_: REAPER requires that extension plugins be prefixed by `reaper_`, otherwise REAPER will not recognize it.
>
> The `reaper_` prefix is added by default in the [`cargo-reaper` configuration file](../configuration-file.md) that is generated by `cargo-reaper-new`,
> however, `cargo-reaper` will throw an error and refuse to compile if an extension plugin listed does not meet this condition.
